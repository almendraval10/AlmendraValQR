Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Pouya Rezazadeh Kalehbasti; Liubov Nikolenko ;  Hoormazd Rezaei
 
The research question of the paper is which model is best suited to predict Airbnb property prices. The authors tested four methods: Ridge Regression, K-means Clustering with Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Neural Network. Their goal is to create a reliable model that helps both hosts and guests determine appropriate prices, even when information is limited.

One of the strengths of the paper’s approach is its comprehensive comparison of multiple models—linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), neural networks, and gradient boosting—to identify the most effective techniques for predicting Airbnb prices. This model diversity allows for a robust evaluation of each model’s ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Additionally, the authors use various feature selection techniques, such as Lasso regularization and sentiment analysis of customer reviews, to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. Furthermore, the paper highlights the use of sentiment analysis on property reviews, which is crucial given the importance of customer opinions in setting Airbnb prices. The opinions for each listing were analyzed using the TextBlob sentiment analysis library. However, the paper also has its limitations. One drawback is that some complex models, particularly gradient boosting, show signs of overfitting despite the feature selection steps. This issue arises from the high-dimensional feature vector, suggesting that further dimensionality reduction or regularization might be beneficial. Another limitation is the scope of the data, as the model is trained solely on Airbnb listings from New York City, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Expanding the dataset to include listings from other cities or even other hospitality services, like VRBO, could improve the robustness of the findings.

This paper contributes to the field of Airbnb price prediction by introducing sentiment analysis of customer reviews, which is uncommon in price prediction research. By integrating customer sentiment as a predictive variable, the paper enriches the model and broadens the field’s understanding of how qualitative factors like reviews can quantitatively influence price predictions. In addition to sentiment analysis, the paper advances knowledge by applying a range of feature selection techniques that improve model accuracy by identifying the most relevant variables for predicting rental prices. Moreover, it incorporates neural networks and sentiment analysis, making it one of the first studies to use sentiment as a predictive factor in this context. These innovations go beyond traditional methods in previous literature, which mainly relied on simpler regression and tree-based models, without considering customer sentiment data. By utilizing these novel techniques, the paper enhances the methodology for rental price prediction and sets a new precedent for including qualitative factors like customer feedback in pricing models.

A valuable next step would be to explore alternative feature selection methods, such as Random Forest feature importance, which could further refine the model by identifying the most impactful variables more effectively. This may help reduce overfitting and improve predictive accuracy by focusing the model’s learning on truly significant features. Another promising direction would be to gather more training data from additional hospitality services, such as VRBO. Expanding the dataset would not only increase the robustness of the model but also improve the generalizability of the predictions across different types of short-term rental markets. This could be particularly beneficial for complex models like K-means clustering with Ridge Regression, which may perform better with a larger and more diverse dataset.
